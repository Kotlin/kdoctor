KDoctor is a command-line tool that helps to set up the environment for [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/mobile/) app development.

![](https://github.com/Kotlin/kdoctor/raw/master/img/screen_1.jpg)

## Overview
KDoctor ensures that all [required components](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kmm-setup.html) are properly installed and ready for use.
If something is missed or not configured, KDoctor highlights the problem and suggests how to fix the problem. 

KDoctor runs the following diagnostics:
* System - checks an operating system version
* JDK - checks that JDK installation and JAVA_HOME setting
* Android Studio - checks Android Studio installation, Kotlin and Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugins 
* Xcode - checks Xcode installation and setup
* CocoaPods - checks ruby environment and cocoapods gem installation

Extra diagnostics:
* Synthetic generated project - downloads and builds project from https://github.com/Kotlin/kdoctor/tree/template
* Local Gradle Project - checks a user's project in the current directory

## Requirements

KDoctor works on MacOS only.

## Installation

### Manual

You can download an archive from GitHub:
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/Kotlin/kdoctor/releases) page
2. Download the latest available version there
3. Unpack it to preferred place

### Homebrew

Install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with the following command:
```bash
brew install kdoctor
```

### Build From Source

To build from source use:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kotlin/kdoctor
cd kdoctor
./gradlew assembleReleaseExecutableMacos
```

## Usage

Call KDoctor in the console and wait till it completes the diagnostics 

```
kdoctor
Diagnosing Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile environment...
```

Once KDoctor finishes the diagnostics, it yields a report.  If no problems are found your system is ready for Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile development:

```
Your system is ready for Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile Development!
```

If KDoctor notifies that there are problems, please review the report:

```
KDoctor has diagnosed one or more problems while checking your environment.
Please check the output for problem description and possible solutions.
```

Check the results of each diagnostic. There are 3 possible statuses:
* `[✓]` - Success
* `[✖]` - Failure
* `[!]` - Warning

Pay the most attention to the failed diagnostics (`[✖]`) and look for messages that start with * for problem description and potential solution. 

It is also worth checking diagnostics with warnings (`[!]`) and even successful messages as they may contain useful notes and tips.

Execute KDoctor with a `-h` option to print all available options

```
kdoctor -h
Usage: kdoctor [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --version      Report a version of KDoctor
  -v, --verbose  Report an extended information
  -a, --all      Run extra diagnostics such as a build of a synthetic project
                 and an analysis of a project in the current directory
  -h, --help     Show this message and exit
```

## Sample verbose output

```
kdoctor -v
